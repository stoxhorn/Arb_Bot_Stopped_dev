Beginnings of an arbitrage bot. Stopped developing, as it required making smart contracts for doing more than one purchase in one transaction. 

I don't know enough about smart contracts to do this, atm. So this is on hold til i've learned this. 

Atm, though. It can read price discrepancies between two DEX'es, and compare and calculate the cheapest pool. 
This was primarily tested on polygon network, between sushiswap and quickswap.

Again, requires input in user_data.txt files, one for each network.
